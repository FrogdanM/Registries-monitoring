# Registries-monitoring

Project Overview
This project is designed to address a common challenge faced by data professionals: working under tight deadlines while needing to extract and process data efficiently. To streamline this process, I developed a solution that enables rapid and customizable data retrieval.

Functionality
The system navigates specified registries, reads and analyzes data related to predefined activities, and disaggregates information based on gender, age, and geographical location. It then generates a structured written report with key insights.

A configuration file governs the process by storing essential parameters, including file paths, column names, and sheet identifiers for data extraction. For privacy considerations, the current data structure within the configuration file has been simplified.
