# Registries-monitoring

Project Overview -
This project is designed to address a common challenge faced by data professionals: working under tight deadlines while needing to extract and process data efficiently. To streamline this process, I developed a solution that enables rapid and customizable data retrieval.

Functionality -
The system navigates specified registries, reads and analyzes data related to predefined activities, and disaggregates information based on gender, age, and geographical location. It then generates a structured written report with key insights. In order to get data for specific months or activities, simply comment out any unnecessary details in the configuration file. This allows for a more refined and targeted data extraction process. To extract data from one or multiple registries, you can specify a varied number of parameters to the main function, allowing for customized data retrieval.

A configuration file governs the process by storing essential parameters, including file paths, column names, and sheet identifiers for data extraction. For privacy considerations, the current data structure within the configuration file has been simplified.
